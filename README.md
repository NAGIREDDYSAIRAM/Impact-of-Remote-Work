# Impact-of-Remote-Work

**Overview**

This project explores the impact of remote work on employees' mental health, productivity, and lifestyle. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of 5000 entries, we aim to uncover trends and insights that can help organizations support their workforce in a remote or hybrid work environment.

**Dataset**

The dataset includes 20 columns covering:

Demographics: Employee age, gender, and region.

Professional Details: Job role, industry, and work experience.

Work Dynamics: Hours worked per week, number of virtual meetings, and work location (remote, hybrid, onsite).

Mental Health Metrics: Stress levels, mental health conditions, work-life balance ratings, and access to mental health resources.

Lifestyle Factors: Physical activity and sleep quality.

Satisfaction and Productivity: Changes in productivity, satisfaction with remote work, company support, and social isolation ratings.
